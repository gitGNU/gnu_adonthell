Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL and NEWBIE files for details.

Note that this package alone doesn't allow you to play anything - 
you'll need a game package in addition to this one. The official
game package for this release is Waste's Edge release 0.3. If you
don't already have it, you should download it and install it next to
this package.


Configuring Adonthell:
======================

The most important settings (Screen Mode, Audio Volume and Language)
can be changed within the game itself. Some additional settings can
only be changed by manually editing the configuration file. This
file is create the first time you run Adonthell, and can usually be
found in: $HOME/.config/adonthell/adonthellrc.


The available options and what they do are:

- Screen-mode

  Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode 
  0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Letterbox mode, 2 = Fullscreen mode
  
  In window mode, a window just small enough to fit your desktop
  is created.
  
  In letterbox mode, the game runs fullscreen at your desktop
  resolution, but preserves its 4:3 aspect ratio. So on 16:9
  or even wider screens common today, you will see a black border
  at the edges of the screen, but the image quality will be good.
  
  In fullscreen mode, your display resolution will be switched 
  to 640x480 and (depending on your display), no border will be
  present. Due to scaling and stretching of the graphics to fit 
  your display, image may appear somewhat blurry.


- Screen

  Which display to use in fullscreen mode in case you are using
  multiple monitors
  0 = your primary display,
  1 = 2nd display,
  2 = 3rd display, 
  and so on

   
- Language [locale]

  Specifies which language to use. As long as this option is unset,
  the language is determined by one of the following environment
  variables: LANG, LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES. Once the option is set,
  it overrides any environment variable. For a listing of valid
  locale strings, run 'locale -a'.
  
  Of course, the game you run has to provide the translation you 
  chose here, otherwise you'll get the default (i.e. English) text.
  Languages available in this package:

  Language    Locale
  ------------------
  Danish      da_DA
  Dutch       nl_NL
  English     C
  French      fr_FR (incomplete)
  Italian     it_IT
  Spanish     es_ES (incomplete)

  If new languages become available, they will be announced on
  our website: http://adonthell.nongnu.org/

  language, please have a look at The Translation Project
  http://translationproject.org/domain/wastesedge.html


- Font [font.ttf]

  Chose a true type font to use for displaying text. 
  
  If the default font doesn't suit you, or if it does not contain
  the glyphs required by the Language you selected, you can specify
  a different font here. Either enter an absolute path to a font
  file in true type format or enter the font name and copy the font
  into <gamedatadir>/gfx/window/font/ .


- Quick-load

  Whether the last saved game should be automatically continued at
  startup. Only works if at least one saved game exists.
  0 = disable, 1 = enable


- Audio-channels

  Whether sound should be mono or stereo
  0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo


- Audio-resolution

  Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit
  0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit


- Audio-sample-rate

  0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz, 2 = 44100 Hz


- Audio-volume

  The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %
  
  (Note that a value of 0 will turn audio completely off)


Running Adonthell:
==================

Okay, now you're ready to launch the program. Type

$> adonthell-0.3 <gamename>

to run the game named <gamename>. To get a list of currently 
installed games you can play, type:

$> adonthell-0.3 -l

This will print a list of the installed games you can launch
with above command.

For further information on how to play Adonthell, please refer to the
PLAYING file that comes with the game data.


Directories:
============

- $HOME/.config/adonthell 
  contains the configuration file

- $HOME/.local/share/adonthell/
  contains your saved games

- Global data directory
  You can get this directory by invoking 'adonthell -d' (by default
  /usr/local/share/adonthell). This is the directory where games will
  install to. If you have a game installed somewhere else, you can
  play it by invoking 'adonthell -g </full/path/to/my/game>'


Release Notes:
==============

The main purpose of this release is to ensure that Adonthell -
Waste's Edge can still be enjoyed on modern operating systems.
To that end, support for newer versions of GCC, SDL and Python 
have been implemented.

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
As the v0.3 implies, the engine is far from being finished, although
it should be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, 
items and magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game
world, and the internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3
is actually playable!

You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you
think we should know. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!
