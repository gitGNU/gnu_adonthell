Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL and NEWBIE files for details.
Note that this package alone doesn't allow you to play anything - 
you'll need a game package in addition to this one. The official
game package for this release is Waste's Edge release 0.3. If you
don't already have it, you should download it and install it next to
this package.


Configuring Adonthell:
======================

The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. Edit it to customise the game to your
convenience.

The available options and what they do are:

- Screen-mode
  Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode 
  0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Fullscreen mode

- Audio-channels
  Whether sound should be mono or stereo
  0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo

- Audio-resolution
  Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit
  0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit

- Audio-sample-rate
  0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz, 2 = 44100 Hz

- Audio-volume
  The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %
  Note that a value of 0 will turn audio completely off


Running Adonthell:
==================

Okay, now you're ready to launch the program. Type

$> adonthell <gamename>

to run the game named <gamename>. To get a list of currently 
installed games you can play, type:

$> adonthell -l

This will print a list of the installed games you can launch
with above command.


Directories:
============

- $HOME/.adonthell 
  contains the configuration file and your saved games.

- Global data directory
  You can get this directory by invoking 'adonthell -d' (by default
  /usr/local/share/adonthell). This is the directory where games will
  install to. If you have a game installed somewhere else, you can
  play it by invoking 'adonthell -g <path-to-my-game>'


Release Notes:
==============

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
It can be considered a technology demo, to show what our current 
engine can do.  It also helps us to locate problems with the engine
and our development tools.

As the v0.3 implies, the engine is not complete, although it should
be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, items and 
magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game world, and the
internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!

You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you
think we should know. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!
