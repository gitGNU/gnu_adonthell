Playing with the map engine:
============================

The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. For now you'll have to add the full
path to the data directory and the map to load at startup manually.

The available options and what they do are:
- Data
  The full path to the Adonthell data directory, 
  e.g. Data [/home/me/adonthell-data]

- Map
  Filename of the map to load at startup, e.g. 
  Map [maptest.map]

- Screen-resolution
  That option is obsolete
  
- Screen-mode
  Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode 
  0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Fullscreen mode

- Audio-channels
  Whether sound should be mono or stereo
  0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo

- Audio-resolution
  Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit
  0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit

- Audio-sample-rate
  0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz,  2 = 44100 Hz

- Audio-interpolation
  Whether to interpolate between samples, improves the quality
  of the music enormously :)
  0 = Off, 1 = On

- Audio-volume
  The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %

All those settings have to be enclosed with

Section [id]
End

The configuration file can have a number of such sections with 
different ID's. At the beginning you can use "Default [id]" to specify
the section that is used by default.

Running the mapengine with a section id as parameter, this special
configuration is loaded.


Okay, now you're ready to launch the mapengine:
./mapengine 
or
./mapengine id

Use the cursor keys to walk around and ESC to quit.

Note:
=====

Actually the engine is only a GRAPHICAL engine, with some event related to
scrolling or position change. Actually it is NOT AT ALL an RPG engine. You just
can walk through maps. That's all. Please report bugs or map problems to
