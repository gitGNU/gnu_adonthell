Release Note:
=============

This release is only a code cleanup release. Before it can be considered as 
totally clean, I have to cleanup the editors code, which is a bug mess.
But now the engine code is safe for your eyes :)
Changes brought to the editors are minor (file selector).

Compilation:
============

To simply test the engine, just type "make". If you want to compile all the 
development tools (map editor, etc...) type "make everything".

Playing with the map engine:
============================

In this directory, type "./mapengine forest.map". The maps are stored in the 
data/ directory. Actually forest.map is the only one available, for 
demonstration purpose (however it lacks of different characters!).
If you have a good computer (i.e P133 or more) and want to try 640x400 res, 
launch "./mapengine forest.map -m1".

Directories:
============

data/ contains all the data needed by the engine to run: a map and the 
graphics.

doc/ contains the documentation (actually only about the map engine - there's 
no doc yet for the editors, sorry)

gfx/ is the graphical management source code directory

map/ contain the source code relative to the map engine

misc/ contain the source code for some other functions (initialization, etc..)

In utils/ you will find the development tools: the pnm to pst converter, the
pattern editor, the map editor and some tools related to characters creation.

Note:
=====

Actually the engine is only a GRAPHICAL engine, with some event related to
scrolling or position change. Actually it is NOT AT ALL an RPG engine. You just
can walk through maps. That's all. Please report bugs or maps problems to
