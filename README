Release Note:
=============

Compilation:
============


Playing with the map engine:
============================

In this directory, type "./mapengine forest.map". The maps are stored in the 
data/ directory. Actually forest.map is the only one available, for 
demonstration purpose (however it lacks of different characters!).
If you have a good computer (i.e P133 or more) and want to try 640x400 res, 
launch "./mapengine forest.map -m1".

Directories:
============


Note:
=====

Actually the engine is only a GRAPHICAL engine, with some event related to
scrolling or position change. Actually it is NOT AT ALL an RPG engine. You just
can walk through maps. That's all. Please report bugs or maps problems to
