Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL and NEWBIE files for details 


Configuring Adonthell:
======================

The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. Unless you install the data file in
/usr/local/share/adonthell-data, you'll have to add the full path to
the data directory yourself.

The available options and what they do are:
(Some of these options might be changable from the main program)

- Data
  The full path to the Adonthell data directory, 
  e.g. Data [/home/me/adonthell-data]

- Map
  Obsolete

- Screen-resolution
  Obsolete
  
- Screen-mode
  Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode 
  0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Fullscreen mode

- Audio-channels
  Whether sound should be mono or stereo
  0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo

- Audio-resolution
  Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit
  0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit

- Audio-sample-rate
  0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz,  2 = 44100 Hz

- Audio-interpolation
  Obsolete

- Audio-volume
  The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %

All those settings have to be enclosed with

Section [id]
End

The configuration file can have a number of such sections with 
different ID's. At the beginning you can use "Default [id]" to specify
the section that is used by default.

When running the mapengine with a section id as parameter, this special
configuration is loaded.


Running Adonthell:
==================

Okay, now you're ready to launch the program:
Type
$> adonthell 
or
$> adonthell <id>
where <id> is a section in your configuration file


Directories:
============
- $HOME/.adonthell 
  contains the configuration file and your saved games.

- /usr/local/share/adonthell
  contains the data files: graphics, music, etc.
  You can install these in a different location, but you'll have
  to update your configuration file in that case.
  (see 'Configuring Adonthell' in this document)


Release Notes:
==============

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
It can be considered a technology demo, to show what our current 
engine can do.  This also helps us to locate problems with the engine
and our development tools.

As the v0.3 implies, the engine is not complete, although it should
be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, items and 
magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game world, and the
internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!
