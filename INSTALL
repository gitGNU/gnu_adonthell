If you are having problems installing the software or want a step-by-
step guide to building and using the Adonthell software, please look
at the NEWBIE file. If you just want the quick-start version of the
install process, here it is.

INSTALLING:

There are four libraries that Adonthell depends on. Three of these
libraries are required, the other is optional. The three REQUIRED
libraries (and where they can be downloaded from) are:

1. Python, version 1.5.2 or later. 
   
   Many Linux distributions (RedHat, SuSE, etc) include Python, but a few
are still using Python 1.5 (or, worse, 1.4!). You will need to have 1.5.2 or
1.6 installed, so please check your version of Python by entering the command:

       python -c 'import sys ; print sys.version'

   You can download Python directly from http://www.python.org.



2. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.0 or later.

   See http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/


3. The SDL_image library, version 1.0 or later.

Sound support under Adonthell is optional (but highly recommended!!).
We suggest building Adonthell with sound support if you have a sound
card configured to run under Linux. To do that, you'll need to build
and install a third library, SDL_mixer.

4. The SDL_mixer library, Version 1.0 or later.

In the top level "adonthell-0.2" directory, type the following:

./configure
make


The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. For now you'll have to add the full
path to the data directory and the map to load at startup manually.
You can also configure various other aspects of the game.

Then, type the following to have the Adonthell mapengine run
a demo map:

./mapengine
