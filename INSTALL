If you are having problems installing the software or want a step-by-
step guide to building and using the Adonthell software, please look
at the NEWBIE file. If you just want the quick-start version of the
install process, here it is.

Should you still have problems, please visit our tech support at
http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=702 .


Requirements:
=============

There are six libraries that Adonthell depends on:

1. Python, version 2.2.1 or later. 
   
   See http://www.python.org/


2. SDL, version 2.0 or later.

   See http://www.libsdl.org/


3. SDL_mixer, version 2.0.0 or later.

   See https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/


4. SDL_ttf, version 2.0.12 or later.

   See https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/


5. Freetype, version 2.0 or later.

   See http://www.freetype.org/
   
   
6. Ogg Vorbis, version 1.0rc3 or later

   See http://www.xiph.org/downloads/


Installing:
===========

From source:
------------

In the toplevel adonthell-0.3 directory type

$> ./configure
$> make

and (as root)

$> make install

For more information, see the README file. Problems? Don't have
the right libraries? Please look at the NEWBIE file or our website

Advanced configure options:
===========================

There are a number of options to 'configure' that might be useful
for you. For a complete list, run 'configure --help'.


--enable-py-debug

  This option turns on debugging output of the embedded python
interpreter to locate bugs in our python scripts. If Adonthell
behaves odd or hangs with no apparent error message, turning
on Python debugging might reveal the source of error. On slower
machines, you shouldn't enable this option unless you need it - 
it may considerably increase Adonthell's CPU usage.


--enable-dlgedit

  Use this to build the Adonthell dialogue editor. Note that 
this requires additional dependencies for compilation, namely
Cairo 1.2.6 or higher and GTK+ 2.18 or higher.


--enable-doc

  Use this to build the Adonthell source code documentation. For 
this to work you will need two additional tools: doxygen and dot.

   See http://www.doxygen.org 

for the first. Latter is a part of AT&T's graphviz toolkit which
can be found at

   http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/.

  The documentation will end up in doc/<subdir>/html/ respectively
doc/<subdir>/latex/, where subdir is one of devel or dlgedit.


--enable-memleaks

  This enables support for mtrace, a tool to find memory leaks.
After compiling you have to set the $MALLOC_TRACE environment 
variable to any file. Running Adonthell will record debugging
information in this file. Use 'mtrace adonthell $MALLOC_TRACE'
to finally display any occurrence of memory leaks.
  
  A much more convenient way to check for memory leaks is the
'memprof' tool: http://people.redhat.com/~otaylor/memprof
  
  Even better than memprof, but not as easy to use is valgrind:
http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/


--disable-nls

  Use this option to disable NLS completely. For more information
regarding this and the previous option, read the ABOUT-NLS file in
this directory.
  

--disable-sdltest
--disable-vorbistest
--disable-freetypetest

  If configure claims to not find the SDL library, Ogg Vorbis or
Freetype, although they are there, or if you try to cross-compile, 
you can disable the respective test. 

Another way to workaround such a problem might be to recreate 
'configure' by running the 'autogen.sh' script.


--with-<x>-prefix=PFX

  This allows you to specify the path to various libraries. (replace
the <x> with the name of the library.) This is useful if you have 
installed those libraries in unusual locations, although it might be
better to set the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or to add
those directories to /etc/ld.so.conf.


--with-data-dir=DIR

  Use this option to customise the location of the data directory.
The default is /usr/local/share/adonthell. Once you have compiled
Adonthell you can query the data directory with 'adonthell -d'.
