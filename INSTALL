If you are having problems installing the software or want a step-by-
step guide to building and using the Adonthell software, please look
at the NEWBIE file. If you just want the quick-start version of the
install process, here it is.


Requirements:
=============

There are two libraries that Adonthell depends on:

1. Python, version 1.5.2 or later. 
   
   Many Linux distributions (Debian, RedHat, SuSE, etc) include Python, but
a few are still using Python 1.5 (or, worse, 1.4!). You can ckeck your 
version of Python by entering the command:

       python -c 'import sys ; print sys.version'

   You can download Python directly from http://www.python.org.


2. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.0 or later.

   See http://www.libsdl.org/


For sound support, you'll also need the SDL_mixer library, Version 1.0 
or later and OggVorbis.

   See http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
   and http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/



Installing:
===========

In the toplevel adonthell-0.3 directory type

./configure
make


The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. For now you'll have to add the full
path to the data directory and the map to load at startup manually.
You can also configure various other aspects of the game.

For more information, see the README file. Problems? Don't have
the right libraries? Please look at the NEWBIE file or our website
