If you are having problems installing the software or want a step-by-
step guide to building and using the Adonthell software, please look
at the NEWBIE file. If you just want the quick-start version of the
install process, here it is.

INSTALLING:

There are three libraries that Adonthell depends on. Two of these
libraries are required, but one is optional. The two REQUIRED
libraries (and where they can be downloaded from) are:

1. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.0 or later.
2. The SDL_image library, version 1.0 or later.

Sound support under Adonthell is optional (but highly recommended!!).
We suggest building Adonthell with sound support if you have a sound
card configured to run under Linux. To do that, you'll need to build
and install a third library, SDL_mixer.

3. The SDL_mixer library, Version 1.0 or later.

In the top level "adonthell-0.2" directory, type the following:

./configure
make

Then, type the following to have the Adonthell mapengine run
a demo map:

./mapengine forest.map

For more information, see the README or file. Problems? Don't have
the right libraries? Please look at the NEWBIE file or our website
