If you are having problems installing the software or want a step-by-
step guide to building and using the Adonthell software, please look
at the NEWBIE file. If you just want the quick-start version of the
install process, here it is.

INSTALLING:

There are three libraries that Adonthell depends on:

1. Python, version 1.5.2 or later. 
   
   Many Linux distributions (RedHat, SuSE, etc) include Python, but a few
are still using Python 1.5 (or, worse, 1.4!). You will need to have 1.5.2 or
1.6 installed, so please check your version of Python by entering the command:

       python -c 'import sys ; print sys.version'

   You can download Python directly from http://www.python.org.



2. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.0 or later.

   See http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/



3. The SDL_mixer library, Version 1.0 or later.

In the top level "adonthell-0.3" directory, type the following:

./configure
make


The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
$HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc. For now you'll have to add the full
path to the data directory and the map to load at startup manually.
You can also configure various other aspects of the game.

Then, type the following to have the Adonthell mapengine run
a demo map:

./mapengine

For more information, see the README or file. Problems? Don't have
the right libraries? Please look at the NEWBIE file or our website
