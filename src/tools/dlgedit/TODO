v 0.3
+ Project management, that allows to store all dialogues
  of one project into a single data and string file.
+ Replace GtkCList of RunDialogue dialog by GtkList to
  allow multiline entries.
+ Code clean up (don´t use GPtrList, ptr_list, int_list
  and Array<T>, but only one of those) I already tried
  but it did not really work :( .
+ Includes are a mess :( - Have to do this better!
+ Replace the dlg_io stuff with the probably faster
  fread () / fwrite () function calls

v 0.4
+ Allowing variables among the text that get replaced at
  runtime with the according string, for example $name
+ Allowing arrows to have condition that decide if the 
  attached circle is selected or not.

  Both of this requires that program variables can be
  accessed through the Dialogue Engine.

+ Adding a dialog to preset above variables, in order
  to test dialogues under various conditions from within
  the Dialogue Editor.
+ Encoding the Strings, so players can´t cheat by simply
  reading the Dialogue texts.
