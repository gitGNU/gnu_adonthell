Adonthell Dialogue Editor INSTALLATION

Requirements:
This tool depends on GTK 1.2.6 or higher. You may compile it with a lower version, but don´t complain if it SEGFAULTS every other minute. The bugs are in GTK, not in the Dialogue Editor ;-)

To test what version of GTK is installed on your machine, type
> gtk-config --version

If you have GTK not installed, get it from http://www.gtk.org


Make also sure you have compiled the dialogue engine, as the editor links with it.

Installation:
cd into the dlgedit/ directory and
> make

Thats all. Have fun :)
