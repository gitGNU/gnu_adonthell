  Text §I am unsure, my friend. All I know is that I found your waterlogged body in the depths of The Lurker's domain. What happened before remains a mystery. I pulled in my nets and within one I discovered you.  §

  Type 2
  Pos 271 408
  Text §Obviously you do not spend any time away from the city to ask such questions. Why, `tis nothing more than the name of the sea. The story goes, that the rains are quite heavy the farther you go away from the shore. It is supposed to have something to do with Mordeas powers. Part of her role as ruling Tempest is to control the rain over the city, but she feels no obligation to extend that to the distant waters. Of course, I never had an unwanted cloud while out to sea myself, so I suspect the name is more rumor than truth. §

  Text §Aye! Tenebrae the city of Eternal Twilight. They say you´ll never find a more lovely place, and I do not disagree, save for one place. But I will say this: the further I am from the Lady, the better I feel. I can tell by your questions that you are not from this land. Came you from another island?§

  Text §I suspected as much, my friend, for your questions are most unusual. I must inform you that, a simple fisherman, I am a poor source of information about our local customs and such. I am sure there must be someone else who can tell you more. Why, I just know the right person. When you get to town, visit Bentic in the library in East Tenebrae. My good friend knows practically all there is to know about our land and its people. Yes, he can certainly help you.§

  Text §The Lurker? That is our name for Hydros, Titan of water. She is a crafty and treacherous one, always ready to pull unwilling victims to their deaths in the depth of the sea . . .  much like what nearly happened to you.§

End

Circle
  Type 2
  Pos 15 591
  Text §I am amazed at how little you know, friend. The Necromancers are the keepers of the cemetery. They have the rather distasteful duty of burying the dead, thus honoring the pact and sending the dead to Lithos.§

  Text §And the Weather! I hear others complain it is as fickle as the Lady, but I know no such thing. I can think of no day at the sea where the sky was not clear and the waves as gentle as a baby`s hand.§

  Text §At first, no one was killed but true criminals, but soon any who showed disagreement was put to the block. I fear for the freedom of the people.§

  Text §Indeed you ask unusual questions. However I know so little about them myself. In town you might find others who can offer so much more assistance.§
