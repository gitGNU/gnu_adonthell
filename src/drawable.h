/**
 * Abstract class for drawable %objects manipulation.
 *
 * This class is designed to allow flexibility in
 * drawable %objects manipulation. It also serves as
 * a template when creating your own classes.
 *
 * It defines the basic virtual methods every drawable
 * object is required to have. When you design such drawable
 * object, make it inherit from this class and overload the virtual
 * functions you wish to use.
 *
 * The main advantage of this class is that it allows you to manipulate
 * any drawable object (image, animation, mapview...) without caring
 * about it's type, at the little cost of having to use virtual methods.
 *
 * There are a few methods that are required to be overloaded
 * in your class. The draw method is a must-have. Your object must also
 * take care to set the size of the drawable correctly (the best thing
 * being that it should use the drawable's size as it's own and don't
 * overload the length () and height () methods).
