* 1.0 - GUIDE INTRODUCTION *
****************************

Welcome to the world of Adonthell! Most software packages for Linux
tend to throw a lot at an unexperienced user when it comes to
installation. We know that not everyone is a Linux or Unix guru, not
everyone knows how to use gzip and tar, and that asking for step-by-
step installation instructions is not too much to ask for. So, we've
created this guide to get you rolling with as little hassle as
possible.

We've made this software distribution as easy to install as we could,
but we can't automate everything for you. You'll have to build and
install a few libraries that Adonthell relies on, then build the
Adonthell game itself.

If you feel that you don't need to have anyone hold your hand during
the installation process, just read the INSTALLATION file in this
directory for the standard install information. If you think you
need a little help or are having problems, then read on.

We're making a few assumptions. Take a quick look at them and see if
you match:

- You are using an Intel x86-based computer. If you aren't, you're out
of luck this time around. Sorry.

- You have a 2.x Linux kernel installed. If you aren't, ask the Linux
guru who installed the 1.x kernel to upgrade, since you probably won't
be able to build the Adonthell software on it.

- You have access to a superuser account (such as root). You'll need
the superuser permissions in order to install the libraries needed by
Adonthell. If you don't have these permissions, bribe your system
administrator to install them for you. Twinkies work well as bribes.
So do Doritos.

- You are running X-windows with a 16-bit color depth. If you aren't,
Adonthell is going to run slow as it compensates for the difference in
color depth. We can compensate for 8, 24, or 32 bit color depths only.
If you can only run in 16 color (4-bit) mode, you're out of luck. Sorry
again.

- You have C/C++ development tools (gcc, ld, etc.) installed on your
system, as well as the basic utility programs 'tar' and 'gzip'.
Practically every Linux installation will install these programs by
default. If you don't have these tools, you've got bigger problems
than just trying to get Adonthell to run.

- You have a sound card configured and running under Linux. If you
aren't, you'll miss out on the music and sound effects, but will still
be able to play the game. As a bonus, though, there is one less library
you'll have to download and install.

******************************************
* 2.0 - OVERVIEW OF THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE *
******************************************

Here is a quick outline of the steps we are going to follow to install
Adonthell:

* Installing the required libraries
  - Downloading the libraries
  - Installing the libraries
  - Configuring your system to use the libraries

* Building the Adonthell source code
  - Downloading the Adonthell source and data package
  - Building the source package
  - Installing Adonthell

* Running Adonthell

* Questions/Help

* Fullscreen Howto

*******************************************
* 3.0 - INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES *
*******************************************

There are four libraries that Adonthell depends on. Two of these
libraries are required, the rest is optional. The two REQUIRED
libraries (and where they can be downloaded from) are:

1. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.2 or later.
2. Python, version 1.5.2 or later.

Sound support under Adonthell is optional (but highly recommended!!).
We suggest building Adonthell with sound support if you have a sound
card configured to run under Linux. To do that, you'll need to build
and install another library:

3. OggVorbis, Version 1.0rc1 or later

********
* NOTE *
********

As of the writing of this guide, you can get the current
version of SDL (1.2.3) at:

    http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2/

... the current version of Python (2.2) at:

    http://www.python.org/

... and the current version of OggVorbis (1.0rc2) at:

    http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/

It usually is safe to use newer versions if available.

***********
* INSTALL *
***********

The following steps show how to install the Python, SDL, SDL_mixer,
and OggVorbis libraries. You must install Python and the SDL library 
FIRST and OggVorbis last.

OggVorbis itself consists of three libraries: libao, libogg and 
libvorbis that have to be installed in this order.


Step #1: Download the tar file of the library to a convient
directory. We suggest downloading to /usr/local/src (if you want to
keep the library source around after you'd built it) or /tmp (if
you don't).

Step #2: Decompress the tar.gz file. Do this by typing:

	tar -xzf SDL-x.x.x.tar.gz           (for SDL)
		    or
	tar -xzf Python-x.x.tar.gz          (for Python)
		    or
	tar -xzf libao-x.x.x.tar.gz         (for libao)
                    
        etc. 

... where the x's are the version numbers of the file you
downloaded. A new directory will be created in the current directory
with the same name as the tar.gz file (minus the .tar.gz extension).

Step #3: Build and install the library. Do this by changing into the
newly created directory and typing:

	./configure
	make
	make install

For 'make install' you have to be logged in as superuser (i.e. root).

Step #4: While logged in to a superuser account (i.e. root),
configure the system linker configuration files to find the newly
installed library. Do this by typing:

	ldconfig

Repeat these 4 steps for each library you want to install. If all
went well, you now at least have Python, SDL, and OggVorbis 
installed and configured in your system.

******************************************
* 4.0 BUILDING THE ADONTHELL SOURCE CODE *
******************************************

Now that the required libraries are built and installed on your
system, you need to build the Adonthell program itself. The
latest version of Adonthell is 0.3. You can download it from the
Adonthell website: http://adonthell.linuxgames.com/download/.


The steps for installing Adonthell are similar to the steps for
installing the libraries above:

Step #1: Download the Adonthell source and data tar.gz files to 
a convenient directory.

Step #2: Decompress the tar.gz files. Do this by typing:

	tar -xzf adonthell-0.3.tar.gz
	tar -xzf wastesedge-0.3.tar.gz	

Two new directories will be created in the current directory, named
"adonthell-0.3" and "wastesedge-0.3". Complete step #3 and #4 for 
both directories.

Step #3: Build Adonthell. Do this by changing into the newly created 
directory and typing:

	./configure
	make

A successful configure will produce an output like this:

	Adonthell v0.3

    SDL ....................... : 1.2.0
    Python .................... : 2.1
    Python debugging .......... : no
    Ogg music ................. : enabled
    Building editors .......... : no
    Building API doc .......... : no
    Data directory ............ : /usr/local/share/adonthell

If everything configured and built with no errors (which it should,
if the SDL libraries were correctly installed), Adonthell will now
be compiled and ready for use. If you installed Ogg Vorbis, the 
configure script will detect it and configure the program to play 
music automatically.

Step #4: Install Adonthell. Finally, you can log in as root and type

	make install

to copy the Adonthell binary to /usr/local/bin and the game data 
to /usr/local/share/adonthell.

*************************
* 5.0 RUNNING ADONTHELL *
*************************

After building the Adonthell source, an executable named "adonthell"
will be created and installed in /usr/local/bin. After installing the
data package, a script called 'adonthell-wastesedge' will be placed
there as well. You can launch Adonthell either by typing

	adonthell wastesedge

or by running the script:

	adonthell-wastesedge

If the game engine and data have been correctly installed, you'll
find yourself in the main menu. Here you can begin a new or continue
an older game. The arrow keys let you move the cursor, and space 
selects an option.

**********************
* 6.0 Questions/Help *
**********************

Q: Why do I get background music, but never any sound effects?

A: Full sound effect support is in the code, and some sound effects
are even loaded into memory when the game is executed. Currently, no
events trigger sound effects, so you won't hear any.


Q: The configure script claims it cannot find SDL (or OggVorbis or
GTK+) on my system, although I know it is there.

A: If you have installed precompiled packages (e.g. RPM'S) of those
liraries, you most likely have to install the corresponding -devel
packages (e.g. SDL-devel.rpm). They should be available where you
obtained the non-devel/runtime packages.

On some systems, it might be necessary to recreate the configure
script to work correctly. Do this by typing './autogen.sh' inside
the adonthell-0.3 directory.


Q: While compiling the Adonthell source code I get an error similar
to the following:

adonthell: error in loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A: You either didn't install the library that the error message is
complaining about or you forgot to type the command 'ldconfig'
as a superuser account (i.e. root) after you installed the library.


Q: When I run Adonthell in fullscreen mode I get a tiny window with
a large black border around.

A: See the Fullscreen Howto below for help.


Q: I have a problem that isn't listed above. Where can I go for
help? How do I contact you?

A: Adonthell has three public mailing lists to provide support, take
suggestions, and interact with the users of the Adonthell software.
Any requests for help can be directed to the tech support manager.
To report bugs, please write to the Adonthell developer mailing list. 
There is usually a fairly short response time for any request of help.

************************
* 7.0 Fullscreen Howto *
************************

Unless you change the $HOME/.adonthell/adonthellrc configuration file,
Adonthell will attempt to run in X11 Fullscreen mode by default.
However, unless you have configured X for the low resolution Adonthell
needs, you'll get a quite small game window with an ugly black border
around. In here is described how to get rid of this.

Since none of the X11 configuration tools I know can setup a 320x240
resolution, you'll have to edit your XF86Config by hand. But don't worry,
you have to do that only once, and none of your current settings will
be lost in the process.

Step #1: Log in as root and locate your X11 configuration file. You'll 
find it in /etc/X11/ under the name of XF86Config or XF86Config-4.
First of all make a backup, so you can revert to a working config 
should something go wrong.

Step #2: Locate the "Monitor" section in the file. Here you might 
already see a number of "Modeline" entries, but probably none that
starts with "320x240". Now pick one of the following modelines that
best matches your monitor and copy it into the monitor section (but 
don't change the HorizSync or VertRefresh entry):

  # -- 15" --
  HorizSync     29-65
  VertRefresh   47-80
  Modeline "320x240" 15.750 320 336 384 400 240 244 246 262 Doublescan

  # -- 17" --
  HorizSync    30-85
  VertRefresh  50-100
  Modeline "320x240" 15.750 320 336 384 400 240 244 246 262 Doublescan

  # -- 19" --
  HorizSync    30-110
  VertRefresh  50-150
  Modeline "320x240" 15.750 320 340 388 432 240 244 246 258 Doublescan

When you are done, your monitor section might look similar to this:

  Section "Monitor"
     Identifier   "Monitor2"
     VendorName   "Hyundai"
     ModelName    "F910"
     HorizSync    30-110
     VertRefresh  50-150
   
     Modeline "1024x768" 85.12 1024 1028 1204 1348 768 768 778 794
     Modeline "640x400" 31.50 640 672 736 832 400 401 404 445
     Modeline "512x384" 22.00 512 564 628 696 384 389 392 404
     Modeline "320x240" 15.75 320 340 388 432 240 244 246 258 Doublescan
  EndSection

Step #3: Locate the "Screen" section. Here you have to specify the
resolutions X11 may use. Add the "320x240" mode to every "Display"
subsection you have. Afterwards, it might look like:

  SubSection "Display"
     Depth  16
     Modes  "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "320x240"
  EndSubSection

The first resolution in the line is the one used by default. When
Adonthell starts, it will select the mode closest to 320x240.

Step #4: Restart X11 and, if everything went well, enjoy Adonthell
truly fullscreen. The first time you use a new mode, you might have 
to adjust your monitor somewhat, but after that you'll be fine.
