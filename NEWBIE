* 1.0 - GUIDE INTRODUCTION *
****************************

Welcome to the world of Adonthell! Most software packages for Linux
tend to throw a lot at an unexperienced user when it comes to
installation. We know that not everyone is a Linux or Unix guru, not
everyone knows how to use gzip and tar, and that asking for step-by-
step installation instructions is not too much to ask for. So, we've
created this guide to get you rolling with as little hassle as
possible.

We've made this software distribution as easy to install as we could,
but we can't automate everything for you. You'll have to build and
install a few libraries that Adonthell relies on, then build the
Adonthell game itself.

If you feel that you don't need to have anyone hold your hand during
the installation process, just read the INSTALLATION file in this
directory for the standard install information. If you think you
need a little help or are having problems, then read on.

We're making a few assumptions. Take a quick look at them and see if
you match:

- You are using an Intel x86-based computer. If you aren't, you're out
of luck this time around. Sorry.

- You have a 2.x Linux kernel installed. If you aren't, ask the Linux
guru who installed the 1.x kernel to upgrade, since you probably won't
be able to build the Adonthell software on it.

- You have access to a superuser account (such as root). You'll need
the superuser permissions in order to install the libraries needed by
Adonthell. If you don't have these permissions, bribe your system
administrator to install them for you. Twinkies work well as bribes.
So do Doritos.

- You are running X-windows with a 16-bit color depth. If you aren't,
Adonthell is going to run slow as it compensates for the difference in
color depth. We can compensate for 8, 24, or 32 bit color depths only.
If you can only run in 16 color (4-bit) mode, you're out of luck. Sorry
again.

- You have C/C++ development tools (gcc, ld, etc.) installed on your
system, as well as the basic utility programs 'tar' and 'gzip'.
Practically every Linux installation will install these programs by
default. If you don't have these tools, you've got bigger problems
than just trying to get Adonthell to run.

- You have a sound card configured and running under Linux. If you
aren't, you'll miss out on the music and sound effects, but will still
be able to play the game. As a bonus, though, there is one less library
you'll have to download and install.

******************************************
* 2.0 - OVERVIEW OF THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE *
******************************************

Here is a quick outline of the steps we are going to follow to install
Adonthell:

* Installing the required libraries
  - Downloading the libraries
  - Installing the libraries
  - Configuring your system to use the libraries

* Building the Adonthell source code
  - Downloading the Adonthell source package
  - Building the source package

* Running Adonthell

* Questions/Help

*******************************************
* 3.0 - INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES *
*******************************************

There are three libraries that Adonthell depends on. Two of these
libraries are required, but one is optional. The two REQUIRED
libraries (and where they can be downloaded from) are:

1. The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library, version 1.0 or later.
2. The SDL_image library, version 1.0 or later.

Sound support under Adonthell is optional (but highly recommended!!).
We suggest building Adonthell with sound support if you have a sound
card configured to run under Linux. To do that, you'll need to build
and install a third library, SDL_mixer.

3. The SDL_mixer library, Version 1.0 or later.

********
* NOTE *
********

As of the writing of this guide, you can get the current
version of SDL (1.0.4) at:

http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/release/SDL-1.0.4.tar.gz

... and the current version of SDL_image (1.0.4) at:

http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/projects/SDL_image/src/SDL_image-1.0.4.tar.gz

... and the current version of SDL_mixer (1.0.4) at:

http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/projects/SDL_mixer/src/SDL_mixer-1.0.4.tar.gz

***********
* INSTALL *
***********

The following steps show how to install the SDL, SDL_image, and
SDL_mixer libraries. You must install the SDL library FIRST, then
install the SDL_image library (and SDL_mixer library if you want
sound), since the other libraries depend on SDL.

Step #1: Download the tar file of the library to a convient
directory. We suggest downloading to /usr/local/src (if you want to
keep the library source around after you'd built it) or /var (if
you don't).

Step #2: Decompress the tar file. Do this by typing:

	gzip -d SDL-x.x.x.tar.gz   	(for SDL)
		    or
	gzip -d SDL_image-x.x.x.tar.gz	(for SDL_image)
		    or
	gzip -d SDL_mixer-x.x.x.tar.gz	(for SDL_mixer)

... where the x's are the version numbers of the file you
downloaded. You'll notice that the file has now dropped the .gz
extension from the end of the filename and is now much bigger
than it was when the file was originally downloaded.

Step #3: Untar the tar file. Do this by typing:

	tar -xvf SDL-x.x.x.tar 		(for SDL)
		   or
	tar -xvf SDL_image-x.x.x.tar	(for SDL_image)
		   or
	tar -xvf SDL_mixer-x.x.x.tar	(for SDL_mixer)

... where the x's are the version numbers of the file you
downloaded. A new directory will be created in the current directory
with the same name as the tar file (minus the .tar extension).

Step #4: Build and install the library. Do this by changing into the
newly created directory and typing:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Step #5: While logged in to a superuser account (i.e. root),
configure the system linker configuration files to find the newly
installed library. Do this by typing:

	ldconfig

Repeat these 5 steps for each library you want to install. If all
went well, you now at least have SDL and SDL_image (and SDL_mixer
if you chose to build it) installed and configured in your system.

******************************************
* 4.0 BUILDING THE ADONTHELL SOURCE CODE *
******************************************

Now that the required libraries are built and installed on your
system, you need to build the Adonthell program itself. The
latest version of Adonthell is 0.2. You can download it from the
Adonthell website: http://adonthell.linuxgames.com.

The steps for installing Adonthell are similar to the steps for
installing the SDL libraries:

Step #1: Download the Adonthell tar file to a convient directory.
We suggest downloading to /usr/local/games.

Step #2: Decompress the tar file. Do this by typing:

	gzip -d adonthell-0.2.tar.gz   	

You'll notice that the file has now dropped the .gz extension
from the end of the filename and is now much bigger than it was
when the file was originally downloaded.

Step #3: Untar the tar file. Do this by typing:

	tar -xvf adonthell-0.2.tar

A new directory will be created in the current directory named
"adonthell-0.2".

Step #4: Build and install the library. Do this by changing into the
newly created directory and typing:

	./configure
	make

If everything configured and built with no errors (which it should,
if the SDL libraries were correctly installed), Adonthell will now
be compiled and ready for use. If you installed the SDL_mixer
library, the configure script will detect it and configure the
program to use sound automatically.

*************************
* 5.0 RUNNING ADONTHELL *
*************************

After building the Adonthell source, an executable named "mapengine"
will be created in the "adonthell-0.2" directory. This is the main
game executable. You can run the game by entering the Adonthell
directory and typing:

	./mapengine forest.map

This will run the game engine with a demo map that was created by
the Adonthell team. If have a fast computer, you might want to try
running the map engine at 640x400 pixels, rather than at the default
320x200 pixels. You can do this by typing:

	./mapengine forest.map -m1

Once the map engine has been run, the introductory cut scene will
begin. Press enter to start the game. You'll be able to use the
arrow keys to wander around the map. Pressing escape while on the map
will bring you back to the introductory cutscene. Pressing escape
during the cutscene will end the program.

**********************
* 6.0 Questions/Help *
**********************

Q: Why do I get background music, but never any sound effects?

A: Full sound effect support is in the code, and some sound effects
are even loaded into memory when the game is executed. Currently, no
events trigger sound effects, so you won't hear any.


Q: While compiling the Adonthell source code, the SDL_image library,
or the SDL_mixer library, I get an error similar to the following:

mapengine: error in loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.0.so.0:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A: You either didn't install the library that the error message is
complaining about or you forgot to type the command 'ldconfig'
as a superuser account (i.e. root) after you installed the library.


Q: While building the SDL_image library, the configure script fails
on the "libPNG" library. What do I do?

A: It's one of two things: you either don't have the PNG graphics
library installed or you have an incompatible version installed.
Either way, you'll need to download and build the PNG graphics
library. It's a default library that comes on most Linux systems, but
you'll need a recent version for libPNG. You can find the latest
version of libPNG at:
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngcode.html


Q: I have a problem that isn't listed above. Where can I go for
help? How do I contact you?

A: Adonthell has three public mailing lists to provide support, take
suggestions, and interact with the users of the Adonthell software.
Any requests for help or bug reports can be directed to the Adonthell
developer mailing list. There is usually a fairly short response time
for any request of help.

The mailing list addresses are:

General topic list:	adonthell-general@lists.sourceforge.net
Developer list:		adonthell-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Graphics list:		adonthell-gfx@lists.sourceforge.net

You can subscribe to these mailing lists by going to the URL:
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=1051

If you'd rather e-mail an Adonthell team member directly, you can get
a list of contacts for the team from the Adonthell web page at:
